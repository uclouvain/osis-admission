With htmx 1.9, inline scripts ($.ready) could be executed but with htmx 2.0, this no longer works very well so
the old scripts are embedded in a function that is trigger after the dom is updated.
The function name must be specified in the data-init-function property of the elements and the associated functions
must be specified in the window.admission namespace.
